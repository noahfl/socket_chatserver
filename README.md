# socket_chatserver

Program that creates a netcat-based chat server. Users can chose a username and chat with other people on the server. The server also used NLTK to report how many nouns are used in each message sent via the server.

##installation
Just download and make sure your NLTK packages are up to date (not doing this will cause the server to break). Also use python3.
